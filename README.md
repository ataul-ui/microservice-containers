All the containers stuff for the cloud native project can be done in this,

the codespaces pull request stuff can be done on this

since this part will be entirely containers, 

so yeah delete the other container stuff from the cloud native project

and also link this repo in the cloud native readme to give examples of containers
that can be uploaded to azure container registry, hmmm maybe use github actions?
idk


explain how to upload to azure container registry using the azure cli, aka follow this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAWLQFi4USk&list=LL&index=1&ab_channel=AdamMarczak-AzureforEveryone 

just cd to the correct folder and type the az command to build and upload the image




also give credits to marcelus demprey provide a link to his git repo I took the code from
