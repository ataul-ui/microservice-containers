All the containers stuff for the cloud native project can be done in this,

the codespaces pull request stuff can be done on this

since this part will be entirely containers, 

so yeah delete the other container stuff from the cloud native project

and also link this repo in the cloud native readme to give examples of containers
that can be uploaded to azure container registry, hmmm maybe use github actions?
idk
